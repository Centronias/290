**Programming Backgoud**
Well I have lots. I'm actually a senior and I'm taking this course because transfer student and credits required for major sort of stuff.
I have extensive experience in programming in C/C++, as well as decent experience with Python. Beyond that, I've programmed (hacked together) a fair amount of PHP stuff, including a socket-based interface into a proprietary database program and a handful of Wordpress plugins.

I like food and videogames.
