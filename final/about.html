		<p>Well, this is my CS290 final. It is a continuation, really, of my <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~santosch/cs290/howto">How To project</a>. This website is meant to be a rudimentary match history website for League of Legends. Make an account, log in, and you'll find yourself on the summoner search page. From there, search for a summoner, like <b>Zirene</b>, and the check out that summoner's matches. Click on a match's row and you'll be taken to more detailed information about that match. This information includes other players whose rows you can click to view their history. This is just about exactly the website I described in my how to.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the login is to allow users to mark summoners and matches as their favorites and also to include notes about summoners and matches. No two uers will see each others' favorites or notes.</p>
