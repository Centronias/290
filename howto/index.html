			<p>We're going to explore the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games API</a> which exposes a small variety of information about their game, League of Legends. The API loosely follows the RESTful philosophy, that is to say that interactions with the server are stateless and all requests to the API are performed by <b>GET</b>ing some specific URL with parameters specified both as request parameters and as portions of the URL itself.</p>
			<p>The first step is to <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/sign-in">make an account</a>. This is necessary because one of the parameters to each API request is an <b>API key</b> which is unique to your account. This allows Riot to track usage and limit requests to a certain number per time interval, which as of writing is 10 requests per 10 seconds.</p>
			<p>From here, it is a matter of deciding what you want to do with the API. The <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods">full API reference</a> gives all of the information necessary to put together some very complex applications and the information exposed keeps growing. For this guide, we will focus on the steps necessary to create a basic match history with detailed statistics about a given match.</p>
